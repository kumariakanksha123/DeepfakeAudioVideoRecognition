# DeepfakeAudioVideoRecognition
Repo containing all the code crossponding to the paper as well as the prepared synchronized deepfake video dataset and the link for this dataset is given below.

Deepfake video synchronized dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1uPc-qg1uVnOcN-POBb0xua8z_YRKiZRO

For deepfake videos creation we have downloaded raw videos from youtube including diversity like different locations, gender, races, age group. And then with the help of tools like text-to-speech real time cloning (wavenet_vocoder) we have generated the fake audio and for syncing these to the appropriate videos have used Wav2Lip method. These methods are publicly available and can be downloaded from the urls given below:
